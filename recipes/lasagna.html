    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="download.jpeg"></img>
    <p>Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a "tough room" when it comes to Italian recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta. I have some recommendations, below: Cut down the water to 1/4 cup. It makes a slightly thicker sauce and I felt the lasagna holds up better that way (although this recipe is good even with more water). Use half parmesan and half romano cheese. It gives a slightly more robust flavor. Put a few tablespoons of the romano/parmesan cheese in with the ricotta mixture. Add a half teaspoon of grated nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture. Increase to one teaspoon of fennel seed. Use 23 ounces of ricotta instead of 16. Use bulk sausage meat if you can find it. Otherwise if you buy link sausage make sure to remove it from the casing and mix it with the ground beef. And finally (and this is very important), make the sauce the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. The sauce tastes better and better as it sits and develops more richness of body and flavor. Trust me, all of these changes will improve the recipe! Mangia!</p>
